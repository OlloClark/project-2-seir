# Furnish LA

## Los Angeles has the most furnished streets I've ever seen.

You can't go more than three blocks without seeing a nice wooden shelving unit,
a dining chair looking down its nose at the rolling deskchair next to it, and enough wooden pallets
to soak up the tar pits.

### *If only there were a way to get the attention of the people who could benefit.*

Enter **Furnish LA**, the new app that allows members of the public to post any street furniture they see, allowing charities, shelters, and other operations to swoop in and grab the items they need.
